# piped_DWDS_microbial_water_quality
CSV files and Jupyter notebooks in R reproducing analyses for "Effect of disinfectant residual, pH, and temperature on microbial abundance in piped drinking water distribution systems" (submitted). To run code, provide filepaths as variables in the "inport csv files" section. Define "path" as the path to where the input data files are located, "path_fig" as the output path for figures, and "path_tab" as the output path for tables. Additionally, this notebook requires the installation of an R kernel for jupyter notebook. Please follow the instructions available at: https://irkernel.github.io/installation/
